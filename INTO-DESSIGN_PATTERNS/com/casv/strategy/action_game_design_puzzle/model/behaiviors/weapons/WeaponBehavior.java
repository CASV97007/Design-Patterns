// This code snippet is defining a Java interface named `WeaponBehavior` in the package
// `com.casv.action_game_design_puzzle.model.behaiviors.weapons`. The interface declares a single
// method `useWeapon()` without any implementation details. Classes that implement this interface will
// need to provide their own implementation for the `useWeapon()` method. This interface is likely
// intended to be used as a blueprint for different weapon behaviors in a game design context.
